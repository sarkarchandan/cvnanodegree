# Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Exercises

This repository is created as a personal workspace cloning from the original [Udacity Computer Vision Exercises Repository](https://github.com/udacity/cd0360-Introduction-to-Computer-Vision). In this repository we have worked on the practice examples amd exercises as we move along with the course.

The `requirements.txt` file has been updated from the original one to represent updated versions of the packages. A CUDA enabled version of the PyTorch package is included along with. Unlike the recommendations described in the [original](https://github.com/sarkarchandan/cvnanodegree/blob/main/SOURCE_README.md) for environment setup we are using a `venv` environment with `PyPI` package manager.
